# Modal Structural Editor
After having a conversation with the professor I am doing research in about structural editors, I decided that I would write my own in the style of Vi(m)

Unfortunately, right now the editor is just a text editor. I am in the process of building the basics of a Vi-like editor.

Progress has also been slowed due to me refactoring what I have to be less coupled together. These changes can be seen in the `refactor` branch.

I have realized that writting my own toolkit is hard and so, I will be moving to a new repo that will be using the `ratatui` library and the `tui-realm` framework.
